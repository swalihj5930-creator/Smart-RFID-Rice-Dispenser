# SMART RFID RICE DISPENSER
This code is used to create a smart and automated rice dispensing system. The RFID module ensures that only registered users can access the machine. Once access is granted, the system uses a load cell to detect the container and measure the rice being dispensed. The user enters the required amount, and the servo motor releases rice until the target weight is reached. The LCD display guides the user through each step, making the system fully automatic and easy to use.
